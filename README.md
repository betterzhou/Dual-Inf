# Explainable Differential Diagnosis With Dual-Inference Large Language Models (Dual-Inf)

## 1. Introduction
This repository contains code for the paper "[Explainable Differential Diagnosis With Dual-Inference Large Language Models](https://www.nature.com/articles/s44401-025-00015-6)" (NPJ Health Systems 2025).



## üî•üî•üî• Highlight: Expert-Annotated Dataset for Differential Diagnosis üî•üî•üî•

We have constructed an **expert-annotated dataset** specifically designed for differential diagnosis!

*An overview of the Dual-Inference Large Language Model framework (Dual-Inf) for interpretable
DDx. Dual-Inf consists of four components: (1) a forward-inference module, which is an LLM to generate
initial diagnoses from patient symptoms, (2) a backward-inference module, which is an LLM for conducting
inverse inference via recalling all the representative symptoms associated with the initial diagnoses, i.e., from
diagnoses to symptoms, (3) an examination module, which is another LLM to receive patients‚Äô notes and the
output from the two modules for prediction assessment (e.g., completeness examination) and decision making
(e.g., filtering out low-confidence diagnoses), and (4) an iterative self-reflection mechanism, which iteratively
takes the low-confidence diagnoses as feedback for the forward-inference module to ‚Äúthink twice‚Äù.*

## 2. Usage
### Requirements:
+ openai==0.28.0
+ python==3.9.19
+ ast
+ pandas


### Our Annotated Datasets: Open-XDDx
The annotated dataset Open-XDDx is available in this repo. 
Each sample is annotated with a set of differential diagnoses (i.e., possible diseases) along with their corresponding diagnostic explanations.

*An example of the annotated data. It contains a set of differential diagnoses (i.e., possible diseases) and the corresponding evidence that supports the diagnosis.*
